INSTRUCTIONS FOR SECOND MACHINE (Phase 2)

---BEGIN PROMPT---

Act as a Senior DevOps Engineer. I need a Bash script (for Git Bash) that processes the REMAINING unstaged changes in my monorepo.

**Context:**
- Phase 1 has already been completed on another machine, which processed buckets 1-5 for both `client/` and `server/` files.
- I now need to process buckets 6-10 for the remaining unstaged files.

**Requirements:**
1. Analyze all current modified/untracked files in the working directory
2. Separate files into `client_files` and `server_files`
3. Divide each group into 10 buckets (same logic as Phase 1)
4. Process buckets 6-10 ONLY:
   - For CLIENT: Create branches `feature/client-part-6` through `feature/client-part-10`
   - For SERVER: Create branches `feature/server-part-6` through `feature/server-part-10`
5. For each branch:
   - Start from `main` branch
   - Add the specific files for that bucket
   - Commit with message "feat(client): update part X" or "feat(server): update part X"
   - Push to origin
6. Verify files exist before committing
7. Use `git checkout main` between branches to ensure independence

**Important:** Skip buckets 1-5 entirely, as they were already processed in Phase 1.

After receiving the script from Copilot, save it as `push_changes_phase2.sh` and run it with:
    chmod +x push_changes_phase2.sh
    ./push_changes_phase2.sh
